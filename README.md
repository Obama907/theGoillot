**Non-technical CEO @ The Mobile First Company**

### Why I'm on GitHub

I sold WordPress sites at 15. Learned Ruby on Rails at 19. Built Spendesk (now $2B) as employee #4.

Now I'm a CEO. My team won't let me commit to production. Fair enough.

But I still spend my nights vibe coding. Building internal tools, experimenting with AI, breaking things. This is where I share what I build and what I learn for other non-technical founders who refuse to stop shipping.

If people star my repos, maybe my engineers will finally let me merge something.

### What We're Building

**Allo** is the first agentic phone system for SMBs.

Not a voicemail. Not a call recorder. An AI that actually handles your calls, has conversations, extracts information, and takes action in your CRM.

We call it **RaaS: Results as a Service.** Software that does the work. Not dashboards you stare at.

20,000+ businesses. $20M raised from Base10, Lightspeed, Emblem.
