**CEO @ The Mobile First Company**

### Why I'm on GitHub

I sold WordPress sites at 15. Learned Ruby on Rails at 19. Built Spendesk (now $2B) as employee #4.

I don't write code anymore. But I hire people who do. And I want them to know who they'd work for.

### What We're Building

**Allo** is an AI business phone for SMBs.

You miss a call. Allo answers it. Transcribes it. Extracts the contact. Updates your CRM. You focus on your business.

That's it. No dashboards. No training. Software that does work, not software you work on.

We call it **RaaS: Results as a Service.** The end of $75/seat subscriptions for tools you'll barely use.

20,000+ businesses. $20M raised (Base10, Lightspeed, Emblem). Miami HQ.
