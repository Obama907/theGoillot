**CEO @ The Mobile First Company** — Building AI that works, not dashboards to stare at.

---

### Why a CEO on GitHub?

I sold WordPress sites at 15. Learned Ruby on Rails at 19. Built my first unicorn fintech by 25.

I stopped writing code daily. I never stopped being a nerd.

GitHub is where builders live. I want to hire the best. I want them to know who they'd work for.

### What I'm Building

**The Mobile First Company** is not another SaaS.

SaaS is dead. The model where you pay $75/seat for dashboards you'll barely use? Over.

We're building **RaaS — Results as a Service.** Software that takes action. AI that does the work while you run your business.

**Allo** is our first product: an AI business phone that answers calls, transcribes, summarizes, and updates your CRM. No training. No setup. Just results.

- 20,000+ businesses using Allo
- 3 minutes from ad to payment
- 65% revenue from US/Canada
- $12M raised from Base10, Lightspeed, Emblem

> "In the AI era, if software doesn't take action, it's not software. It's a dashboard."

### The Vision

We're building an AI operating system for small business:

| Product | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Allo** (live) | AI business phone — calls become data, data becomes action |
| **Expense** | AI handles receipts and categorization |
| **Invoicing** | AI gets you paid faster |
| **CRM** | AI runs your sales memory |

One problem. One app. Done right. No bloat.

SMBs don't need more software. They need less work.
